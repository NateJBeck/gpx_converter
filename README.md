####GPX Converter

This app is a simple utility that allows a user to upload a `csv` file
consisting of up to 150 simple addresses (ex: 1 Main St, Boston, MA) while using
Geocoder to geocode the address information. 

The user can then download a file containing the geocoded information, formatted
as `.gpx` (a type of XML used in modern Garmin devices).

The `.gpx` can then be used to quickly construct optimized delivery routes by
importing route information to Garmin BaseCamp, without the need for expensive 
optimization software.
